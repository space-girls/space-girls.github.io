about:Trevcan

Hello there, I'm a human! 
I'm into programming, computers, and of course,
the beloved *linux* (I use [arch](http://archlinux.org) btw).
I like learning about new things, and enjoy riding
bikes, reading books such as 1984 (George Orwell), talking to people,
and breathing.

And yeah, I've decided to start writing / blogging so yeah this is me
attempting to set up a minimalist blogging system with blogit I guess
and a tad of github actions automation with gh pages.

### Software used:

- webserver - [lighttpd](https://www.lighttpd.net/), pronounced *lightly*.
- `markdown` or `discount` > A Markdown implementation written in C. 
	- it's in the arch repos as the `discount` package but installs a program called `markdown` among other things.

- Web page styling (CSS) by tocttou's [hacker-blog](https://github.com/tocttou/hacker-blog/blob/master/_sass/base.scss)
  - with slight modifications from myself.
- my fork of [blogit](https://git-trevcan.duckdns.org/blogit.git/tree/README.md)
