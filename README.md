# Trevcan's website
Hello, i do not know how you have stumbled upon me but please 
let me know.

this is my website and it is based on [my fork](http://git-trevcan.duckdns.org/blogit)
 of blogit, made originally by [Pedantic software](http://pedantic.software/git/blogit).

## Dependencies
- rsync
- git
- make
- *nix system (tools like grep, sed, curl, etc.)
- blogit

note: the RSS description/summary tags are kinda broken right now. I will try to fix this in the future.

so yeah, this is where I host my markdown-based blog posts.

If you want to start your blog with my version of blog it, I would not recommend cloning this repo.
