blogit \- a small static blog generator

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B blogit
.RB [ init | build | deploy | clean ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B blogit
is a small static blog generator, using a markdown-like syntax and git capabilities.
For example, first posted and last edited dates are extracted from git history.

.SH GETTING STARTED
Run "blogit init" and follow the interactive configuration.
This will create the basic structure and initialize a git repository.

.SH STRUCTURE
Articles are created in the
.B articles
directory, using a markdown-like syntax (see
.BR SYNTAX ).
HTML templates (configurable chunks of HTML code that will be used for static page generation) are stored in the
.B templates
directory, and can be edited (see
.BR TEMPLATES ).
Additional data can be stored in the
.B data
directory and will be copied at the root of the website.
Redirect links can be added to the
.B data
directory.

To create a local version of the blog, run "blogit build".
It will be available in the
.B blog
directory, and the main page is index.html.
Note that only articles known to git will be created (this is to prevent unfinished articles to be published).
When its ready for publication, commit the changes to the git repository, and build the blog using "blogit build".
Then run "blogit deploy" to publish the site with
.BR rsync (1)
to the remote configured at the beginning.
